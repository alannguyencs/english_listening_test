Hi, George! Glad you're back. Loads of people have phoned you.
Really?
I felt just like your secretary!
Sorry! I went into the library this afternoon to have a look at a newspaper and I came across something really interesting.
What? A book?
No, a brochure from a summer festival - mainly Spanish music. Look, I've got it here. 
Spanish music? I really love the guitar. Let's have a look. So what's this group 'Guitarini'?
They're really good. They had a video with all the highlights of the festival at a stand in the lobby to the library, so I heard them. They play fantastic instruments - drums and flutes and old kinds of guitar. I've never heard anything like it before.
Sounds great.
Okay. Sall we go then? Spoil ourselves?
Yes, let's.

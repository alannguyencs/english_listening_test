Hi Geogre,
Glad you're back
Loads of people have phoned you
Really?
I felt just like your secretary
Sorry, I went to the library this afternoon
to have a look at a newspaper 
and I came across something really interesting 
What? a book?
no, a brochure from a summer festival, mainly Spanish music
look at what I've got at here
Spanish music? I really love the guitar. Let's have a look
So, what's this group? Guitarini
They're really good. They have a video with all the highlights of the festival 
at the stand in the lobby to the library. So I heard them
They play fantastic instruments: drums, flutes, all kinds of guitars
I never heard anything like it before
Sounds great
Ok, so we go then. Spoil it ourselves
yes, let's
